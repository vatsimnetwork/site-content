title: Join VATSIM
---

VATSIM is completely free to join and use, including all of our pilot and ATC software that allows you to connect to our global network. Whether you want to join us as a virtual Pilot or virtual Air Traffic Controller, the initial registration process is the same.

## Useful Documents
You will be required to agree to a couple of documents as a part of the signup process. You can find all our policy [documents on our website.](https://www.vatsim.net/documents) However you may specifically wish to review:
* [VATSIM User Agreement](https://www.vatsim.net/documents/user-agreement)
* [VATSIM Code of Conduct](https://www.vatsim.net/coc)
* [VATSIM Privacy Policy](https://www.vatsim.net/documents/privacy-policy)

## Registration
In order to join VATSIM, you must be at least **13 years of age**.

> If you have previously been a VATSIM member and your account is inactive, please do not create a new account. Instead, you can reactivate your old account by visiting the **[members help page](https://www.vatsim.net/members/member-help)**. This will also reinstate any previous ATC rating you had and will continue to log flight statistics against previously logged stats. Members may hold only one VATSIM identification number and password. **([Code of Conduct A6](https://www.vatsim.net/documents/code-of-conduct))**

If you're new to VATSIM, please follow the instructions on the [Sign Up Page](https://my.vatsim.net/register). When you've completed this form you'll have to confirm your email address and will receive your account details.

## Get Started

Once you have your account details, you can get started as a pilot or a controller. To do so, we suggest you first read the [Pilot's Getting Started](https://www.vatsim.net/pilots/getting-started) page or find your local [Region/Division websites](https://www.vatsim.net/region) for more information about ATC Training.

You can find all the links on this website to software you will need to connect as a [Pilot](https://www.vatsim.net/pilots/software) or [Air Traffic Controller](https://www.vatsim.net/air-traffic-control/software).
